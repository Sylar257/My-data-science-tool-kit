              " \n",
              "  xxmaj unfortunately , while the film is xxunk important and has some lovely performances , it 's also a mess . xxmaj the main plot is very similar to the xxmaj hollywood xxunk of the era -- including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day . xxmaj however , the writing is just god - awful and a bit trashy at times -- and projects images of xxmaj black xxmaj america that some might find a bit xxunk . xxmaj this is because before the plot really gets going , you are treated to a no - account xxunk who lives off his hard working wife ( a popular stereotype of the time ) and when he is caught with a xxunk ( who , by the way , totally xxunk this role ) , they have a fight which looks like a scene from xxup xxunk xxmaj xxunk ! xxmaj and , the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor -- a trashy scene indeed ! xxmaj later in the film , when the prima donna is behaving xxunk , her husband punches her in the face and everyone xxunk him ! xxmaj it seems like the film , at times , wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience xxup plus they ca n't even do this well -- with some of the worst acting i 've seen in a very long time . \n",
